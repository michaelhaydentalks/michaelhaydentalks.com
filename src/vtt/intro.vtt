Hello.

3
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.500
Thank you for joining me here today.

4
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.500
My name is Michael Hayden 

5
00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.000
and I’m a retired Roman Catholic priest.

6
00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.000
I’ve been a priest for over 40 years now

7
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.500
and I’ve spent a considerable chunk of my life

8
00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.500
thinking about the Christian message,

9
00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.500
observing how other people live this message,

10
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.000
and trying always, to look at things with an open mind,

11
00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:33.500
and not be scared 

12
00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.000
of ideas that don’t fit the traditional mould. 

13
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.000
While you’re here, 

14
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.000
have a look at some of the short videos I’ve recorded, 

15
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.500
where I share some of what I’ve learnt over the years 

16
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.500
and invite you to respond 

17
00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.500
with any questions or feedback 

18
00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.000
so that we keep on teaching each other.

19
00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.000
Thank you.
